These API calls translate the queried datasets into local dataframes without locally downloading any municipality's permitting dataset.\n","\n","##**Specification Output**\n","\n","The output of the GBDS is a comma-separated value (.csv) file that can be uploaded as a feature-layer in this project's ArcGIS Online generated map"],"metadata":{"id":"UmewFAs3RnuN"},"id":"UmewFAs3RnuN"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#**Specification Field Metadata**"],"metadata":{"id":"CL_coCFq0Bwb"},"id":"CL_coCFq0Bwb"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##**Field Data Types and Field Notes**"],"metadata":{"id":"zpZ5D0RbRfJi"},"id":"zpZ5D0RbRfJi"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["| Field Name                            | Field Category | Existing Data Type Per Field | Desired Data Type Per Field   | Recommendation Notes/Desired Data Type Notes                                                                                     |\n","|---------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n","| Unique Building Identifier            | Recommended    | object()                     | string()                      | REC: Each city should identify at least ONE (1) of these identifying numbers (Building or Land/Parcel)                           |\n","| Unique Land Identifier                | Recommended    | object()                     | string()                      | REC: Each city should identify at least ONE (1) of these identifying numbers (Building or Land/Parcel)                           |\n","| Building Street Number                | Required       | object()                     | string()                      | DTYPE: Should be a string() data type to capture Street Numbers with both alpha and numeric characters                           |\n","| Building Street Name                  | Required       | object()                     | string()                      | DTYPE: Should be a string() data type to capture Street Names with both alpha and numeric characters                             |\n","| Building City                         | Recommended    | object()                     | enumerated()/string()         | DTYPE: This field would be an enumerated list of previously entered string() value - with allowance for new string() value input |\n","| Building State                        | Recommended    | object()                     | enumerated()                  | DTYPE: An enumerated list of United States state abbreviations - with data-validation                                            |\n","| Building Zip Code                     | Recommended    | object()                     | integer()/string()            | DTYPE: 5-digit zip codes will be recorded as integer() values - while 9-digit (ZIP+4) values will be recorded as string() values |\n","| Building Country                      | Recommended    | object()                     | DEFAULT string()/enumerated() | U.S.A.
